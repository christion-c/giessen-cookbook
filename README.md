## About

The ADHD-Friendly Cookbook is built to remove stress, friction, and monotony from the cooking process. Many traditional recipes assume the reader has perfect focus, uninterrupted time, and strong executive function. This cookbook embraces the opposite: real life, short attention spans, sensory needs, and the desire for cooking to actually feel fun.
